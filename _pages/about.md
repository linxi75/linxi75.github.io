I am a master's student at Columbia University, specializing in Quantitative Methods in Social Science with a focus on data science. With a strong foundation in economics and a passion for leveraging data to address real-world challenges, I specialize in machine learning, data analysis, and natural language processing.
My professional experience spans media, finance, and luxury retail. At China Central Television (CCTV), I researched and produced content on major international topics, driving significant audience engagement and deepening my interest in how media shapes public discourse. Iâ€™ve also gained analytical experience at Guolian Securities, where I provided strategic insights into financial products, and at Louis Vuitton, where I contributed to customer retention and sales growth.
Beyond work, I enjoy traveling, exploring diverse cuisines, photography, and playing badminton.

## QMSS Practicum Project
The INDRA project by Columbia QMSS and Alt Surya Inc., aims to develop a predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. Utilizing machine learning and multiple data sources, the system will enhance disaster preparedness for residents and businesses. The main objectives are to predict cloudburst occurrence within a 6-hour window, estimate intensity and potential impact, and achieve a prediction accuracy surpassing the current 50% benchmark in target locations. The project involves assessing and preprocessing relevant datasets, developing predictive models, and refining accuracy through validation and analysis.
