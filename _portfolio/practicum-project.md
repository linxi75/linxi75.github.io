## Project Overview
The INDRA project, sponsored by Columbia University's QMSS program and AltSurya Inc., aims to develop a predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. The system will utilize machine learning and multiple data sources to enhance disaster preparedness for residents and businesses. The key objectives include predicting cloudburst occurrence within a 3-hour window, estimating intensity and potential impact, and achieving a prediction accuracy surpassing the current 50% benchmark in target locations. The project involves data preprocessing, model development, and performance evaluation.
